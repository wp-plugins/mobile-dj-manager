In addition I would stay in regular contact with you to ensure the night goes to plan. I can incorporate your own playlists, a few songs you want played, requests on the night, or remain in full control of the music - this is your decision, but I can be as flexible as required.\r\n\r\nMobile DJs are required to have both PAT and PLI (Portable Appliance Testing and Public Liability Insurance). Confirmation of both can be provided.\r\n\r\nIf you have any further questions, or would like to go ahead and book, please let me know by return.\r\n\r\nI hope to hear from you soon.\r\n\r\nBest Regards\r\n\r\n{DJ_FULLNAME}\r\n\r\nEmail: <a href=\\"mailto:{DJ_EMAIL}\\">{DJ_EMAIL}</a>\r\nTel: {DJ_PRIMARY_PHONE}\r\n<a href=\\"http://{WEBSITE_URL}\\">{WEBSITE_URL}</a>';

Should you wish to contact me at any stage to discuss your disco, my details are at the end of this email.\r\n<h2>What Now?</h2>\r\n<strong>Music Selection & Playlists</strong>\r\n\r\nWe have an online portal where you can add songs that you would like to ensure we play during your disco.

The playlist feature will close {PLAYLIST_CLOSE} days before your event.\r\n\r\nYou will need to login. Your username and password have already been sent to you in a previous email but if you no longer have this information, click on the lost password link and enter your user name, which is your email address. Instructions on resetting your password will then be sent to you.\r\n\r\nYou can also invite your guests to add songs to your playlist by providing them with your unique playlist URL - <a href=\\"{PLAYLIST_URL}\\">{PLAYLIST_URL}</a>. We recommend creating a <a href=\\"https://www.facebook.com/events/\\">Facebook Events Page</a> and sharing the link on there. Alternatively of course, you can email the URL to your guests.\r\n\r\nDon\'t worry though, you have full control over your playlist so you can remove songs added by your guests if you do not like their choices.\r\n\r\n<strong>When will you next hear from me?</strong>\r\n\r\nI generally contact you again approximately 2 weeks before your event to finalise details with you. However, if you have any questions, concerns, or just want a general chat about your disco, feel free to contact me at any time.\r\n\r\nThanks again for choosing {COMPANY_NAME} to provide the DJ & Disco for your event.
