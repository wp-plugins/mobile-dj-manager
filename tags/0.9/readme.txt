Mobile DJ Manager allows mobile DJ's and businesses to manage their events and employees as well as interact with  their clients easily. 

== Description ==

Mobile DJ Manager is the solution for Mobile DJ's who work on their own or businesses that employ multiple DJ's.

It is an event planning solution built specifically for websites running on WordPress ensuring the users are familiar with the Administration settings and look and feel.

Mobile DJ Manager allows you to manage your events from enquiry stage through to completion. Add your DJ's, your clients and then create an event.

As a site admin you will be able to view all information, but as a DJ, depending on the permissions set by the Administrator, you will only see those events that are specific to you.

Email automation is also built in, depending on your chosen settings. Quotes can be automatically sent to clients when an event is created, contracts can be issued automatically and digitally signed, and booking confirmations also emailed to both clients and DJ's alike.

As a client, you gain access to a number of features via the main website once you login. These include;
*	Profile management ensuring that the DJ has all the relevant contact details at all times
*	Playlist management
*	Invite guests to add songs to the playlist via a unique URL. Clients can remove songs they do not deem appropriate

The main dashboard provides a complete overview of your business detailing the number of events and earnings over the month and year.

All in all Mobile DJ Manager helps you to run your DJ business efficiently.
